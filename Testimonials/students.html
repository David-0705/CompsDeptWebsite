                      I am ever grateful to the group of distinguished lecturers and HOD who guided & escorted me to strengthen my technical skills as well as my personality.
                      The Computer department encouraged me to explore my talent & potential by providing an exceptional integrated learning
                      environment (through coding competitions, technical workshops, labs etc.). I also attribute my success in getting a job
                      to the education and support provided by the TPO and the placement cell team.
